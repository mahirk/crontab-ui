###Common issues
__crontab-ui is running but is not accessible on browser__ - 
This is usually because the place where your crontab-ui is installed does not give access to others. It can be resolved by either giving permission to the user (Recommended) or running crontab-ui as root. Refer [this](https://github.com/alseambusher/crontab-ui/issues/8)

__Hosting crontab-ui : it works on localhost but not outside the server__ - You have to host it using nginx, apache2, etc. Refer [this](nginx.md).
